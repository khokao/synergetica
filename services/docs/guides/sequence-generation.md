This page provides an explanation of sequence generation.

## Generating sequences

After designing circuit & adjust desired parameters in simulation, you can generate optimized sequence.

To start generation, press the `Run` button in the `Generation` section.

During the generation process, a popup like the below will appear. If you want to stop the generation, you can by pressing the "Cancel" button.

!!! Info
	The time required for generation vary depending on the number of chains and the memory status of your Computer.

	(For a detailed explanation of the generation algorithm, please see <u>[this section](#technical-details)</u>.)

## Viewing results

Once the generation is complete, the popup will disappear, and the Result button will become clickable.

When you press the Result button, a window like the one below will open.

A Chain ID is assigned to each chain and you can see generated sequence for each chain separately.
