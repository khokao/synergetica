## Starting simulations

- After designed your desired circuit, you can simulate it by clicking **"Start"** button in the Simulation section.
- If the simulation is successful, the right side tab will open and the simulation results section will be displayed.

!!! info "Info (Cirtcuit validtion)"
	If the designed circuit is invalid, you can't click **"Start"** button. please check [<u>this page</u>](./circuit-design.md#completing-valid-circuits) for about circuit validation.

!!! Tip "Info (API connection)"
    Check the :lucide-zap: icon at the simulation section to confirm that youâ€™re connected to the backend API. If not connected, you can't click **"Start"** button.

    - :lucide-zap:{ .zap-on } : Connected to the API
    - :lucide-zap-off:{ .zap-off } : Not connected to the API

## Adjusting parameters

- In the simulation result section, parameter bars corresponding to each protein nodes appear.
- Sliding the parameter bar immediately updates the simulation results for that parameter.
- Parameter values can also be changed by entering directly to the value box.

!!! Note
	The parameter range is fixed at 1-20,000 for all parts, so if the entered value was over 20,000, it will automatically be modified to 20,000.

??? Tip  "Tip (When multiple protein nodes with the same name)"
	- If there are **multiple protein nodes with the same name**, numbering suffix are automatically attached to those part names (e.g: BM3R1 [1], BM3R1 [2], ...).
	- You can distinguish the correspondence by the color of the outer border of the protein node and the color next to the parameter bar.
	- However, the concentration(Y-axis) displayed in the simulation graph is the **sum of all the same name protein node**.

## Technical details

- Synergetica simulates time concentration changes of all protein for designed circuits.
- When the Start button of the simulation is pressed, a differential formulation is formulated according to the structure of the circuit, and an approximate solution is obtained by Euler's method.


### Formulation

-  In Synergetica, the equations and part parameters are based on [**Cello** (Nielsen, Alec AK, et al. Science, 2016)](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aac7341), a leading study in genetic circuit design.
