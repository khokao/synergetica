## Building circuits

In this guide, you can learn more about how to create a genetic circuit using Synergetica.

### Block types

#### Promoter
A promoter controls the timing and strength of transcription for the downstream DNA sequence. Specific proteins can bind to it to either activate or repress transcription.

![Protein part](../assets/imgs/guides/circuit-design/protein.png){ align=left width="200" }

#### Protein

A protein is a functional entity that is actually produced within a cell. In living organisms, proteins serve as the functional components responsible for various biological processes.

#### Terminator

A terminator marks the end of transcription and also plays a role in regulating the degradation rate of the DNA strand.

!!! info
	When multiple identical terminators exist, homologous recombination may occur, potentially altering the DNA sequence. To prevent this, Synergetica offers multiple terminator variants.

!!! note
	For more details about the specific parts within each category, please refer to <u>[this page]()</u>.


### Method 1: Arranging blocks

Designing a circuit with the GUI

**Placing block**

- You can place any block by dragging it from the block placement area at the top of the application and dropping it onto the main area.

**Delete block**

- There are two ways to delete a block.

A. Select the block and press the `DELETE` key.

B. Click the overflow menu button and select `Delete`.

**Connect blocks**

- When you drag a new block and bring it near an already existing block, the blocks will automatically connect to each other.

![](../assets/imgs/tutorial/dnd_new_parts.png)

!!! Info
	In Synergetica, this connected unit of blocks is called a **chain**.

**Disconnect blocks**

- When you place the mouse cursor on the edge between blocks, an "Ã—" button will appear. Clicking this button will allow you to separate the blocks.

- Alternatively, you can disconnect by dragging the part from the chain beyond a certain distance.

### Method 2: Defining YAML configurations

Circuit can be designed through coding with DSL.

**Basic Structure of DSL**

- The components of a genetic circuit have to be defined within the `chain` array. Each element has a `type` (type of block) and a `name` (parts name).

- As the elements (`type` and `name`) described in YAML from top to bottom, the blocks will be connected **from left to right**

```yaml
- chain:
    - type: Promoter
      name: PameR
    - type: Protein
      name: AmeR
    - type: Terminator
      name: L3S3P31
```

**Import & Export YAML file**

- Synergetica can import & export the YAML configurations by clicking highlighted buttons in the below image.

!!! Success
	So you can **save and share your project** through YAML file.

!!! Tips
	The graphical design with blocks and the DSL are always synchronized, allowing you to alternate between design methods at any time.


## Completing valid circuits

- In Synergetica, designed circuits are automatically checked to ensure they are biologically valid.
- Validation results are showed in the bottom of DSL pallet and the icon highlighted in the below image.

**Valid**
![](../assets/imgs/guides/circuit-design/valid.png)

**Invalid**
![](../assets/imgs/guides/circuit-design/invalid.png)

!!! Warning
	If the designed circuit is invalid, `Simulation` can't be conducted.

Here are basical rules of valid circuit.

**Rule of Blocks**

- `type` and `name` are not missed.
- Value of `type` is included in [`Promoter`,`Protein`,`Terminator`]
- Value of `name` is included in the parts list of each block type (<u>[See here for detail]()</u>)

**Rule of Chains**

- Chain must start with Promoter(s)
- A promoter cannot appear after Proteins.
- After Promoter(s), at least one Protein must follow before a Terminator.",
- No elements are allowed after the Terminator.(Chain must end with a Terminator)

??? Success "Valid circuit examples"

	- Minimum valid circuit.

	- Multiple Protein is allowed.

	- Multiple Promoter is allowed

??? Failure "Invalid circuit examples"

	- Chain must start with Promoter(s)

	- No elements are allowed after the Terminator.(Chain must end with a Terminator)

	- Empty block is not allowed.
